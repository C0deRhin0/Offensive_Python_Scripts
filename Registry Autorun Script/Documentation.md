# About
This code is designed to create a Windows registry entry that enables automatic execution of a file named rhino.exe upon user login or system boot. The program generates the executable using a script (BuildExe.py), moves it to a specific directory (Temp), and then writes a registry key that allows the executable to run automatically.

---

## Risk
This code introduces several potential risks for a victim if implemented with malicious intent:
- Persistence: By adding a registry entry under Run or RunOnce, the executable can automatically execute at boot or login without user consent.
- Silent Execution: The executable is created and executed silently, making it difficult for the victim to detect.
- Privilege Escalation: If the registry entry is written under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE, it would require administrative privileges, which could give the program higher-level access.
- Data Theft or System Compromise: If the rhino.exe executable is malicious, it could steal data, install keyloggers, or compromise system integrity.

## Code Block
- **File Setup and Cleanup** Creates a Temp directory and sets up the path for rhino.exe. Removes any existing instance of the file to avoid conflicts.
-  **Executable Creation and Moving** Runs BuildExe.py to generate the executable. Moves the file to the Temp directory.
-  **Registry Modification** Connects to the Windows registry. Sets the registry key under HKEY_CURRENT_USER or HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE. The key allows the executable to run automatically at boot or login.

## Notes
- The code is not inherently malicious but introduces serious security risks if implemented with malicious intent.
- If the rhino.exe file contains malware or spyware, this registry-based persistence could make it difficult for the victim to detect and remove.
- Writing to HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE requires administrative privileges, which could be exploited to gain deeper system access.
