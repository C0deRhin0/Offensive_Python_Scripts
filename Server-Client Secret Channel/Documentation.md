# About
This code demonstrates a secure communication channel using Python sockets and AES encryption. The client sends encrypted messages to the server over a TCP connection. The server decrypts the messages using the shared key and displays the original content.

---

## Risk
The code itself is not malicious but can be adapted for malicious use. Potential risks include:
- **Eavesdropping:** If the key or IV is compromised, an attacker could decrypt the communication.
- **Man-in-the-Middle Attack:** If the connection is not properly authenticated, an attacker could intercept and modify the messages.
- **Code Injection:** If the decrypted message is processed insecurely, it could lead to remote code execution.

## Code Block
1. **encrypt_message:**  The `encrypt_message` function pads the message to a multiple of 16 bytes and encrypts it using AES in CBC mode.
2. **Sending Data:** The client generates a random IV, sends it to the server, and then sends the encrypted message.
3. **Decrypt_message:** The decrypt_message function decrypts the received data using the shared key and IV.
4. **Receiving Data:** The server reads the IV and message length, then decrypts the received data.

## Notes
The code is not inherently malicious, but it could be dangerous if adapted for:
- **Data exfiltration:** Encrypting and transmitting sensitive information without detection.
- **Command execution:** Sending and decrypting commands for remote execution.
- **Reverse shell:** Establishing an encrypted channel to control a compromised machine remotely.
