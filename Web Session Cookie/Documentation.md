# About
This code extracts sensitive cookies from the Opera GX browser. It scans the browser's cookie database and filters out targeted cookies from major platforms like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon. The extracted data is written to a file for further analysis.

---

## Risk
This code introduces several significant risks:
- **Session Hijacking:** Captured session cookies can be used to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to user accounts.
- **Identity Theft:** Stolen cookies may contain sensitive data that can be used to impersonate the user.
- **Persistent Access:** If used to extract and reuse session cookies, it could allow prolonged unauthorized access to the victim's accounts.

## Code Block
### Key Components:
1. **Database Connection:**
   - `sqlite3.connect()` opens the Opera GX cookie database.

2. **Data Retrieval:**
   - `cur.execute("SELECT host_key, name, value FROM cookies")` extracts host, cookie name, and value.

3. **Targeted Cookie Filtering:**
   - The code checks for targeted cookies from high-value platforms (e.g., Google, Amazon).

4. **Data Output:**
   - Extracted cookies are written to a text file.
   - `os.system("notepad.exe cookie_dump.txt")` opens the file for easy viewing.

## Notes
This code is not inherently malicious but shows how session and authentication cookies can be extracted without user consent. If modified to automatically send extracted data to a remote server or decode encrypted cookies, it could lead to account hijacking and identity theft.
