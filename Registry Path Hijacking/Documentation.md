# About
This code manipulates the Windows system's `PATH` environment variable by appending a directory (`MaliciousFolder`) to it. By doing so, any malicious executable placed inside this folder could be executed unintentionally when system commands are run.

---

## Risk
The code introduces a severe security risk through **RegPath Hijacking**:
- Attackers can inject malicious files with common system command names (e.g., `ping.exe`, `cmd.exe`).
- Since the malicious folder is added at the start of the `PATH` variable, the system may prioritize those files over legitimate system commands.
- This method is stealthy and may persist even after rebooting.

---

## Code Block
### Key Components That Enable RegPath Hijacking:
1. **`readPathValue()`**  
   - Reads the current `PATH` environment variable to identify existing paths.
   - Identifies the "Path" entry in the registry and returns its value.

2. **`editPathValue()`**  
   - Uses `readPathValue()` to obtain the current `PATH`.
   - Appends the attacker-controlled folder (`MaliciousFolder`) to the beginning of the `PATH` variable.
   - Writes the modified path back to the registry.

3. **`for` loop targeting both `HKEY_CURRENT_USER` and `HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE`**  
   - Ensures persistence across user profiles and system-wide execution.

## Notes
This code is not inherently malicious. However, if modified and implemented with malicious intent, it can be used to hijack system commands by introducing a rogue executable in the attackerâ€™s injected directory. As a result, this technique can compromise system integrity and allow unauthorized command execution.

Extreme caution is advised when testing or deploying this code.
